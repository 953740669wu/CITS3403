            <p class="small-desc2">
                Both cats and dogs need regular medical care, including vaccinations, deworming, and bathing. Prompt visits and following the vet's recommendations 
                are essential to their health. In order to avoid excessive stray animals and health problems, spaying and neutering cats and dogs is necessary. 
                This not only helps control animal populations, but also helps improve their behavior and health.

            <p class="small-desc3">
                Cats and dogs have their own food taboos. For example, dogs can't eat foods such as chocolate, onions,
                garlic, and cats are allergic to dairy products and can't eat foods such as onions and chocolate. In additon,
                Citrus (oranges, lemons, tangerines) are acidic fruits, although rich in vitamin C, but also stimulate the cat's stomach, 
                if used in excess, it is easy to cause vomiting or diarrhea.
